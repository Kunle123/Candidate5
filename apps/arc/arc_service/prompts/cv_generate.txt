**ENUMERATED COMPREHENSIVE CV GENERATION - EXPLICIT ROLE LISTING**

You are generating a complete CV using the candidate's profile data accessed via the get_candidate_profile function.

**🚨🚨🚨 EXPLICIT ENUMERATION APPROACH 🚨🚨🚨**

**STEP 1: PROFILE DATA EXTRACTION**
1. Call get_candidate_profile function FIRST
2. Extract the complete work_experience array
3. List each role explicitly: Role 1, Role 2, Role 3... Role N
4. **NOTE:** Skills, education, and certifications are NOT provided in the profile:
   - Skills: Derive from work experience descriptions and match to job description
   - Education & Certifications: Will be added automatically - DO NOT include in your response

**🚨🚨🚨 CONTENT VOLUME & DETAIL REQUIREMENTS 🚨🚨🚨**

**TARGET:** Generate a comprehensive, detailed CV (4+ pages worth of content)

**CRITICAL:** Include ALL roles from profile even if it exceeds page target. Page limits are guidelines, NOT hard cutoffs. Completeness > page count.

**BULLET DISTRIBUTION BY ROLE RECENCY:**
- **Roles 1-3 (Most Recent):** 6-9 bullets per role - MAXIMUM DETAIL
- **Roles 4-6:** 5-7 bullets per role - HIGH DETAIL  
- **Roles 7-10:** 4-6 bullets per role - MODERATE DETAIL
- **Roles 11-15:** 3-5 bullets per role - STANDARD DETAIL
- **Roles 16+:** 2-3 bullets per role - ESSENTIAL DETAIL (but still include them!)

**BULLET ORDERING WITHIN EACH ROLE:**
1. **Position 1 (Top Bullet):** Most job-relevant achievement/responsibility with quantifiable impact
2. **Position 2:** Second most job-relevant achievement/responsibility  
3. **Positions 3+:** Remaining bullets ordered by relevance to job description

**DETAIL LEVEL REQUIREMENTS:**
- Each bullet should be comprehensive and detailed (not sparse summaries)
- Include ALL bullets from the profile for each role
- Preserve exact wording from profile - do not abbreviate or condense
- If a role has 7 bullets in the profile, include all 7 bullets in the CV

**STEP 2: EXPLICIT ROLE ENUMERATION**
You must explicitly process each role:
- Role 1: [Company 1] - [Title 1] - [Dates 1]
- Role 2: [Company 2] - [Title 2] - [Dates 2]
- Role 3: [Company 3] - [Title 3] - [Dates 3]
- ...continue for ALL roles in profile...
- Role N: [Company N] - [Title N] - [Dates N]

**STEP 3: MANDATORY INCLUSION VERIFICATION**
Before proceeding, confirm:
- "I have identified [X] roles in the profile"
- "I will include all [X] roles in the CV"
- "No roles will be omitted or combined"

**🚨🚨🚨 MANDATORY PRIVACY PROTECTION 🚨🚨🚨**
- **Name Field:** MUST use placeholder "{{CANDIDATE_NAME}}" - NEVER use actual names
- **Contact Info:** MUST use placeholder "{{CONTACT_INFO}}" - NEVER use actual contact details

**🚨🚨🚨 EXPLICIT WORK EXPERIENCE PROCESSING 🚨🚨🚨**

**ROLE PROCESSING TEMPLATE:**
For each role in the profile, create this exact structure:

```json
{
  "company": "[EXACT_COMPANY_FROM_PROFILE_ROLE_N]",
  "title": "[EXACT_TITLE_FROM_PROFILE_ROLE_N]",
  "start_date": "[EXACT_START_DATE_FROM_PROFILE_ROLE_N]",
  "end_date": "[EXACT_END_DATE_FROM_PROFILE_ROLE_N]",
  "location": "[EXACT_LOCATION_FROM_PROFILE_ROLE_N]",
  "bullets": [
    {
      "content": "[MOST_JOB_RELEVANT_BULLET_WITH_QUANTIFIABLE_IMPACT]",
      "priority": "[PRIORITY_BASED_ON_ROLE_RECENCY]",
      "relevance_score": 1
    },
    {
      "content": "[SECOND_MOST_JOB_RELEVANT_BULLET]",
      "priority": "[PRIORITY_BASED_ON_ROLE_RECENCY]",
      "relevance_score": 2
    },
    {
      "content": "[THIRD_MOST_RELEVANT_BULLET]",
      "priority": "[PRIORITY_BASED_ON_ROLE_RECENCY]",
      "relevance_score": 3
    }
    // ... continue for ALL remaining bullets ordered by relevance
    // Include ALL bullets from profile for this role
  ]
}
```

**CRITICAL BULLET ORDERING RULES:**
1. **Analyze ALL bullets** for the role against job description
2. **Rank by relevance** - bullets matching job keywords/requirements go first
3. **Top 2 positions** MUST be the most job-relevant bullets
4. **Include ALL bullets** from profile - do not omit any
5. **Preserve exact wording** - reorder only, don't modify content

**MANDATORY ROLE INCLUSION RULES:**
- ✅ **Create separate role object** for each work experience in profile
- ✅ **Include ALL bullet points** for each role exactly as stated
- ✅ **Use exact company names** from profile
- ✅ **Use exact job titles** from profile
- ✅ **Use exact dates** from profile
- ❌ **NEVER skip any roles** from the profile
- ❌ **NEVER combine multiple roles** into single entries
- ❌ **NEVER omit bullet points** to save space

**🚨🚨🚨 ACHIEVEMENTS EXTRACTION RULES 🚨🚨🚨**

**PURPOSE:** Create a "highlight reel" of the candidate's most impactful accomplishments across ALL roles that demonstrate relevant experience for this job.

**EXTRACTION RULES:**
1. **Scan ALL work experience bullet points** across all roles (not just recent ones)
2. **Identify quantifiable achievements** with numbers, metrics, or measurable impact
3. **Prioritize by job relevance** - achievements that match job requirements get Priority 1
4. **Include evidence source** - note which company/role each achievement came from
5. **Extract 5-10 key achievements** that build a comprehensive picture of capability
6. **Use exact wording** from profile - do not embellish or fabricate

**PRIORITIZATION CRITERIA:**
- **Priority 1:** Directly matches job requirements + quantifiable impact
- **Priority 2:** Relevant to job domain + demonstrates key skills
- **Priority 3:** Demonstrates transferable skills + notable accomplishment

**EXAMPLES OF GOOD ACHIEVEMENTS:**
- "Led migration of platform to AWS, reducing infrastructure costs by 40%"
- "Coordinated 20+ suppliers for mobile payments integration"
- "Delivered data lake capability integrating 20+ data sources"
- "Managed teams of 50+ across multiple international locations"

**🚨🚨🚨 ENUMERATED PRIORITY ASSIGNMENT (FOR WORK EXPERIENCE) 🚨🚨🚨**

**EXPLICIT PRIORITY MAPPING:**
- **Roles 1-3 (Most Recent):** Priority 1
- **Roles 4-7:** Priority 2
- **Roles 8-12:** Priority 3
- **Roles 13-17:** Priority 4
- **Roles 18+ (All Remaining):** Priority 5

**PRIORITY ASSIGNMENT VERIFICATION:**
For each role, explicitly assign priority:
- Role 1: Priority 1 (most recent)
- Role 2: Priority 1 (recent)
- Role 3: Priority 1 (recent)
- Role 4: Priority 2
- Role 5: Priority 2
- ...continue explicit assignment...
- Role 18: Priority 5 (if applicable)

**🚨🚨🚨 ANTI-FABRICATION WITH ENUMERATION 🚨🚨🚨**

**ZERO FABRICATION RULES:**
- **Copy exact text** from profile for each enumerated role
- **Use exact bullet points** without modification
- **Maintain exact company names** and job titles
- **Preserve exact dates** and locations
- **Do NOT add any content** not in the profile
- **Do NOT enhance descriptions** beyond profile content
