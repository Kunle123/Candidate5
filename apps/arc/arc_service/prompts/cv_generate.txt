**CV GENERATION - COMPLETE PROFILE ENUMERATION**

You are generating a complete CV using the candidate's profile accessed via get_candidate_profile function.

**CRITICAL RULES:**

1. **PROFILE ACCESS:** Call get_candidate_profile function FIRST, extract complete work_experience array
2. **COMPLETE ENUMERATION:** Include ALL roles from profile (even if 15-20+ roles spanning 25+ years)
3. **NO OMISSIONS:** Every role gets a separate entry - no combining, no filtering by relevance
4. **AUTHENTIC BULLETS:** Use ONLY bullets from profile - no fabrication, no paraphrasing to create "variety"
5. **DE-DUPLICATION:** Remove exact/near-duplicate bullets within same role (keep most complete version)
6. **ACTUAL COUNTS:** If profile has 3 bullets for a role, output 3 (not 6-9). If it has 10, output all 10
7. **SMART ORDERING:** Top 2 bullets per role = most job-relevant with quantifiable impact
8. **PRIVACY:** Use "{{CANDIDATE_NAME}}" for name, "{{CONTACT_INFO}}" for contact, "{{CANDIDATE_LOCATION_FROM_PROFILE}}" for location

**CONTENT VOLUME & BULLET DISTRIBUTION:**

**TARGET:** Comprehensive CV (4+ pages of content). Completeness > page count (include ALL roles even if exceeds target).

**BULLET DISTRIBUTION BY RECENCY (USE ONLY AVAILABLE BULLETS):**
- **Roles 1-3 (Most Recent):** All bullets from profile, ordered by job relevance (typically 6-9 if available)
- **Roles 4-6:** All bullets from profile, ordered by job relevance (typically 5-7 if available)
- **Roles 7-10:** All bullets from profile, ordered by job relevance (typically 4-6 if available)
- **Roles 11-15:** All bullets from profile, ordered by job relevance (typically 3-5 if available)
- **Roles 16+:** All bullets from profile, ordered by job relevance (typically 2-3 if available)

**CRITICAL:** These are typical distributions based on what's ACTUALLY in the profile, NOT minimums to fabricate.
- If profile has 4 bullets for a role → output exactly 4
- If profile has 10 bullets for a role → output all 10
- More detail in recent roles, but NEVER omit older roles

**BULLET ORDERING:** Within each role, top 2 bullets MUST be most job-relevant with quantifiable impact

**ACHIEVEMENTS:** Scan ALL work experience bullets across ALL roles. Extract 5-10 quantifiable achievements most relevant to job. Include evidence_source (company/role where it occurred).

**SKILLS:** Derive from work experience and match to job requirements. Skills, education, and certifications are NOT in profile - skills derived from work descriptions, education/certs added automatically (don't include in your response).

**VALIDATION BEFORE RETURNING:**
- Total roles in CV = Total roles in profile
- ALL unique bullets from profile included for each role (no omissions, no duplicates)
- Top 2 bullets per role are most job-relevant
- 5-10 achievements extracted from work experience bullets with evidence_source
- Skills derived from work experience
- Projects from profile included
- Education/certifications NOT in response (added automatically)

**FAILURE CONDITIONS:**
- Any role from profile missing in CV
- Omitting older roles to "fit" page limit
- Fabricating bullets to reach target counts
- Including duplicate/near-duplicate bullets in same role
- Paraphrasing bullets for "variety"
- Achievements without evidence_source
- Including education/certifications in response

Return ONLY the JSON object. No markdown formatting, no explanatory text.
