**CV GENERATION - COMPLETE PROFILE ENUMERATION**

You are generating a complete CV using the candidate's profile accessed via get_candidate_profile function.

**CRITICAL RULES:**

1. **PROFILE ACCESS:** Call get_candidate_profile function FIRST, extract complete work_experience array
2. **COMPLETE ENUMERATION:** Include ALL roles from profile (even if 15-20+ roles spanning 25+ years)
3. **NO OMISSIONS:** Every role gets a separate entry - no combining, no filtering by relevance
4. **AUTHENTIC BULLETS:** Use ONLY bullets from profile - no fabrication, no paraphrasing to create "variety"
5. **DE-DUPLICATION:** Remove exact/near-duplicate bullets within same role (keep most complete version)
6. **ACTUAL COUNTS:** If profile has 3 bullets for a role, output 3 (not 6-9). If it has 10, output all 10
7. **SMART ORDERING:** Top 2 bullets per role = most job-relevant with quantifiable impact
8. **PRIVACY:** Use "{{CANDIDATE_NAME}}" for name, "{{CONTACT_INFO}}" for contact, "{{CANDIDATE_LOCATION_FROM_PROFILE}}" for location

**CONTENT TARGETS (NOT MINIMUMS TO FABRICATE):**
- Roles 1-3: All bullets, ordered by job relevance
- Roles 4-10: All bullets, ordered by job relevance
- Roles 11+: All bullets, ordered by job relevance
- Completeness > page count (include all roles even if exceeds 4 pages)

**ACHIEVEMENTS:** Scan ALL work experience bullets across ALL roles. Extract 5-10 quantifiable achievements most relevant to job. Include evidence_source (company/role where it occurred).

**SKILLS:** Derive from work experience and match to job requirements. Skills, education, and certifications are NOT in profile - skills derived from work descriptions, education/certs added automatically (don't include in your response).
