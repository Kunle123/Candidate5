**CV GENERATION - BATCHED ROLE PROCESSING**

You are generating a complete CV using batched access to the candidate's profile (5 roles at a time).

**üö® CRITICAL BULLET RULE - READ THIS FIRST:**
**INCLUDE ALL MEANINGFUL, NON-REPETITIVE BULLETS**
- Start with ALL bullets from the profile for each role
- Remove ONLY if a bullet is genuinely repetitive or redundant within the SAME role
- Prioritize and reorder remaining bullets by job relevance
- **AVOID:** Arbitrary reduction (e.g., "max 3-4 bullets per role")
- **AIM FOR:** Include most/all bullets unless truly redundant
- **BALANCE:** Comprehensive coverage vs. avoiding repetition

**üö® MANDATORY PROCESS - STEP BY STEP:**

**STEP 1: Get Total Role Count**
- Call `get_role_count()` function FIRST
- This returns `{"role_count": N, "batch_size": 5}`
- Example: If N=17, you need to call get_roles_batch 4 times (0-4, 5-9, 10-14, 15-16)

**STEP 2: Get Candidate Metadata**
- Call `get_candidate_metadata()` to get projects, languages, interests
- This gives you everything EXCEPT work_experience

**STEP 3: Fetch All Role Batches**
- Call `get_roles_batch(start_index=0)` ‚Üí Returns roles 0-4
- Call `get_roles_batch(start_index=5)` ‚Üí Returns roles 5-9
- Call `get_roles_batch(start_index=10)` ‚Üí Returns roles 10-14
- Call `get_roles_batch(start_index=15)` ‚Üí Returns roles 15-16 (last batch)
- **Continue until you've fetched all N roles**

**STEP 4: Verify All Roles Received**
- Before generating CV, mentally list ALL companies from ALL batches:
  * Batch 0: [Company 1, Company 2, Company 3, Company 4, Company 5]
  * Batch 1: [Company 6, Company 7, Company 8, Company 9, Company 10]
  * Batch 2: [Company 11, Company 12, Company 13, Company 14, Company 15]
  * Batch 3: [Company 16, Company 17, ...]
- Count total companies = X
- Your CV MUST include exactly X role objects

**STEP 5: Generate Complete CV**
- Process ALL roles you received from ALL batches
- Create one role object in CV for each role from profile
- Order bullets within each role by job relevance
- FINAL CHECK: Count roles in your output JSON = must equal X from Step 4

**CRITICAL RULES:**

1. **MANDATORY:** Fetch ALL batches (if role_count=17, fetch batches at 0, 5, 10, 15)
2. **ZERO OMISSIONS:** Every role from every batch must appear in final CV
   - **DUPLICATE COMPANY NAMES:** If the same company appears multiple times with different dates, include BOTH/ALL as separate role objects
   - **EMPTY DESCRIPTIONS:** If a role has an empty description array, still include it with a generic bullet based on the job title
3. **AUTHENTIC BULLETS:** Use ONLY bullets from profile - no fabrication (except for roles with empty descriptions)
4. **DE-DUPLICATION:** Remove near-duplicate bullets within same role ONLY (not across different roles)
5. **SMART BULLET ORDERING:** Within each role, order bullets by:
   - Position 1-2: Most job-relevant bullets with quantifiable impact
   - Position 3+: Other relevant bullets, most impactful first
6. **DETAIL LEVEL:** Recent roles (1-3) should have maximum detail, older roles (16+) should be more concise
7. **PRIVACY & LOCATION HANDLING:** 
   - Use "{{CANDIDATE_NAME}}" for personal_information.name
   - Use "{{CONTACT_INFO}}" for personal_information.contact
   - Use "{{CANDIDATE_LOCATION_FROM_PROFILE}}" for personal_information.location ONLY
   - **CRITICAL - Work Experience Locations:**
     * Use ONLY the exact location from the profile if it exists
     * If location field is empty/null/missing in profile ‚Üí OMIT the location field entirely from that role
     * **DO NOT infer, guess, or fabricate locations**
     * **DO NOT use city names, country names, or "Remote" unless explicitly in profile**

**CONTENT VOLUME:**
- Target: 4+ pages
- Include ALL roles even if exceeds page target
- Completeness > page count

**BULLET DISTRIBUTION BY ROLE RECENCY:**

**SMART BULLET INCLUSION - BALANCE DETAIL WITH CLARITY**

The profile provides different numbers of bullets for each role. Your job is to:
1. **START** with all bullets from the profile
2. **REMOVE** only genuinely repetitive/redundant bullets within the same role
3. **REORDER** remaining bullets by job relevance (most relevant first)
4. **AIM** to include most bullets, especially for recent roles

**Typical Output After Smart De-duplication:**
- **Roles 1-3 (Most Recent):** 6-10 bullets (include nearly all if meaningful)
- **Roles 4-6:** 5-8 bullets (remove only clear duplicates)
- **Roles 7-10:** 4-6 bullets (consolidate if needed)
- **Roles 11-15:** 3-5 bullets (keep most impactful)
- **Roles 16+ (Oldest):** 2-4 bullets (essential highlights only)

**CRITICAL RULES FOR BULLETS:**
1. **SMART DE-DUPLICATION:** Remove bullets that say essentially the same thing within a role
2. **NO ARBITRARY LIMITS:** Don't reduce to "max 3-4 bullets" just because you think CVs should be short
3. **PRESERVE DETAIL:** Recent roles should have substantial detail (6-10 bullets is normal)
4. **NO FABRICATION:** Only use bullets from the profile
5. **QUALITY OVER QUANTITY:** But don't sacrifice important achievements for brevity

**ACHIEVEMENTS:** Extract 5-10 quantifiable achievements from across ALL work experience bullets with evidence_source (company/role).

**SKILLS:** Derive from work experience. Education/certifications added automatically (don't include in response).

**üö® VALIDATION BEFORE RETURNING:**

**ROLE COUNT VERIFICATION (MANDATORY - YOU WILL FAIL IF THIS IS WRONG):**
1. List EVERY company name AND date range from EVERY batch you fetched (including duplicates)
2. Count total roles across ALL batches you fetched: X roles
3. **CRITICAL:** If the same company appears twice with different dates (e.g., "Npower Digital May 2019-Dec 2019" AND "Npower Digital Jul 2017-Mar 2019"), count them as 2 SEPARATE roles
4. **CRITICAL:** If a role has an empty description array, still count it and include it in your CV
5. Count roles in your CV professional_experience.roles array: Y roles
6. **ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT:** X must equal Y
7. If X ‚â† Y, you FAILED - DO NOT return the CV, regenerate with ALL missing roles

**Example Verification:**
- Batch 0: Allpay, TfL, Npower (May), Npower (Jul), B60 = 5 roles
- Batch 1: C3UK, National Grid, RBS, First Group, Storywall = 5 roles
- Batch 2: Vodafone, Acision, France Telecom, Orange PCS (PM), Orange PCS (R&D) = 5 roles
- Batch 3: Test Supply Chain, Transport for Wales = 2 roles
- **TOTAL: 5+5+5+2 = 17 roles**
- Your CV output MUST contain exactly 17 role objects in professional_experience.roles
- NO EXCEPTIONS - NO SUMMARIZATION - NO "MOST RELEVANT" SELECTION - ALL 17 ROLES

**If you return fewer than X roles, you have FAILED this task completely.**

**BULLET COUNT VERIFICATION (QUALITY CHECK):**
1. For EACH role in your output, count the bullets
2. Compare to the bullet count from the corresponding role in the profile
3. **GUIDELINE:** Aim to include most bullets from profile (e.g., 6-8 out of 9, not 3 out of 9)
4. **RED FLAG:** If a recent role has only 3 bullets but profile had 9, you over-reduced
5. **ACCEPTABLE:** If profile had 9 bullets with 3 near-duplicates, outputting 6-7 unique bullets is good

**Example Bullet Verification:**
- Profile Role 1 (Allpay): 9 bullets ‚Üí CV Output: 6-9 bullets (removed only duplicates)
- Profile Role 2 (TfL): 12 bullets ‚Üí CV Output: 8-12 bullets (kept meaningful detail)
- Profile Role 3 (Npower): 6 bullets ‚Üí CV Output: 5-6 bullets (minimal reduction)
- **AVOID:** Reducing 9 profile bullets to just 3 output bullets (too aggressive)

**FAILURE CONDITIONS:**
- ‚ùå Not fetching all batches (stopped at batch 2 when there were 4 batches)
- ‚ùå Role count mismatch (fetched 17, outputted 8)
- ‚ùå Omitting roles from any batch
- ‚ùå Fabricating bullets
- ‚ùå Including duplicate bullets
- ‚ùå **BULLET COUNT MISMATCH (fetched role with 9 bullets, outputted 3)**
