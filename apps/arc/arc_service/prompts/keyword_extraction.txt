### METADATA EXTRACTION GUIDELINES

**Job Title Extraction:**
- Look for phrases like "Job Title:", "Position:", "Role:", or titles in headers
- Extract the most specific title mentioned (e.g., "Senior Software Developer" not just "Developer")
- If multiple titles mentioned, use the primary/main one

**Company Extraction:**
- Look for company names, organization names, or "Company:" labels
- Extract full company name if available
- Use "Not specified" if no company name is found

**Experience Level Extraction:**
- Look for phrases like "X+ years", "Senior", "Junior", "Entry-level", "Executive"
- Extract the most specific requirement (e.g., "5+ years" rather than just "experienced")
- Combine seniority level with years if both present (e.g., "Senior (5+ years)")

**Industry Extraction:**
- Identify the business sector or industry context
- Use standard industry terms (e.g., "Technology", "Financial Services", "Healthcare")
- Infer from company type, job requirements, or explicit mentions
