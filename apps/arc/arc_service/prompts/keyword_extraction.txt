2. **Seniority/level requirement** (Senior level, Lead position, Manager level, Executive level)

### DETERMINISTIC PRIORITY ASSIGNMENT

**HIGH Priority (Exactly 5 keywords):**
- All keywords appearing in job title
- Technical skills marked as "required" or "essential"
- Experience qualifiers that are mandatory
- Skills mentioned 3+ times in description
- Core functional skills central to role

**MEDIUM Priority (Exactly 7 keywords):**
- Skills mentioned 2 times in description
- Qualifications listed as "preferred" or "desired"
- Important technical skills not in title
- Secondary functional skills
- Primary industry terms
- Important soft skills

**LOW Priority (Exactly 5 keywords):**
- Skills mentioned once in description
- Soft skills that are implied but not emphasized
- Secondary industry terminology
- Nice-to-have qualifications
- General experience qualifiers

### JOB METADATA EXTRACTION (DETERMINISTIC)

**Job Title Extraction (Systematic approach):**
1. Search for explicit labels: "Job Title:", "Position:", "Role:", "Vacancy:"
2. If not found, identify the most specific title in headers or opening paragraph
3. If multiple titles exist, select the one with most detail/specificity
4. Preserve exact wording from description

**Company Extraction (Systematic approach):**
1. Search for explicit labels: "Company:", "Organization:", "Employer:"
2. Look for company names in headers, footers, or contact information
3. Identify organization names in context of "join our team" or similar
4. Use "Not specified" only if no company identifier found anywhere

**Experience Level Extraction (Systematic approach):**
1. Search for explicit years: "5+ years", "10+ years", "3-5 years"
2. Identify seniority indicators: "Senior", "Lead", "Principal", "Manager", "Executive"
3. Combine both if present: "Senior (5+ years)"
4. Use most specific requirement found in description

**Industry Extraction (Systematic approach):**
1. Identify explicit industry mentions in job description
2. Infer from company type, role requirements, or business context
3. Use standard industry classifications (Technology, Financial Services, Healthcare, etc.)
4. Select most specific industry term that accurately applies
