# Alembic Migration Issues Analysis

## Issues Identified:

### 1. Root Level Migration Configuration (CRITICAL)
- [ ] Root `migrations/env.py` imports `cv_models` but connects to `arc_db`
- [ ] Database URL hardcoded to `arc_db` but using CV service models
- [ ] This causes cross-database model/connection mismatch
- [ ] Root migration should be removed as it conflicts with service-specific migrations

### 2. AI Service Configuration (UNNECESSARY)
- [x] AI service has no models - it's a stateless service
- [ ] Remove ai_service Alembic configuration as it's not needed
- [ ] AI service doesn't require database migrations

### 3. Service-Specific Configurations (MOSTLY CORRECT)
- [x] arc_service env.py properly configured with its own models (UserArcData, CVTask, WorkExperience)
- [x] cv_service env.py properly configured with its own models (CV, Experience, Education, etc.)
- [x] user_service env.py properly configured with its own models (UserProfile, TopupCredits)

### 4. Database URL Configuration Issues
- [ ] All services use same DATABASE_URL environment variable
- [ ] Need separate database URLs for each service
- [ ] Services should connect to their respective databases

## Services and Expected Databases:
- ai_service -> NO DATABASE NEEDED (stateless service)
- arc_service -> ARC_DATABASE_URL (manages user arc data, CV tasks, work experience)
- cv_service -> CV_DATABASE_URL (manages CV documents and related data)
- user_service -> USER_DATABASE_URL (manages user profiles and credits)
- root migrations -> SHOULD BE REMOVED

## Next Steps:
- [x] Fix root migration configuration
- [x] Complete ai_service migration setup (removed - not needed)
- [x] Create proper database URL configuration for each service
- [x] Create fix script and documentation
- [x] Create helper scripts for database setup and migrations
